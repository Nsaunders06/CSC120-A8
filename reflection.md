Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is a tooth fairy class. It represents a tooth fairy and all the things that they can do! Through the implmentation of the code the tooth fairy is able to collect teeth and notes as well as assess if it is safe to enter a room. All of the notes and teeth they collect then go into a fairy bag which can be added too and have things removed. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added an enter room class which allows the fairy to check is the room is the correct room and if the child is asleep so they can saftely enter. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I spent a lot of time brainstorming for this assignement but as a result ended up running out of time to code my program and ended up planning out a code that was more complicated then it needed to be. I therefore would advise that you still plan but, throughout the planning process be really aware of what is reasonable for you to do and what isn't.
